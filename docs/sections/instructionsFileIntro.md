What is an instructions file?  
The instructions file is the instructions for manipulating a set of YAML files and documents.  It is a YAML document that contains an array of paths to YAML files, directories, and documents within YAML files to perform operations.  Each instructions file starts with the optional key `commonOverlays`, which is an array, along with a required key `yamlFiles` which is also an array.
